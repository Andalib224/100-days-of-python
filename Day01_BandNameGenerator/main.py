# Day 01 - Band Name Generator ðŸŽ¸
# -------------------------------------------
# This project generates a fun band name by
# combining the name of a city and a pet.
# It's a beginner-level project to practice:
# - Taking user input
# - String concatenation / f-strings
# - Writing clean, reusable code
# -------------------------------------------
